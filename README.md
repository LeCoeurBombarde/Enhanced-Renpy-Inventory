### Inventory System Overview

This project builds upon my previous work, "Simple Ren'Py Inventory." The original inventory system was straightforward and beginner-friendly but lacked some common advanced features found in many games. In this new version, I have added several advanced features to enhance the basic inventory system and elevate the overall user experience. The Inventory System is designed to be flexible and dynamic, allowing for effective item and slot management. Players can store, organize, and interact with items while also incorporating progression mechanics, such as unlocking additional inventory slots as the game progresses. This system has been developed with scalability in mind, making it suitable for a variety of gameplay styles, including simple inventory management, dating simulations, visual novels, and complex RPG mechanics.

### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Slot Management**:
   - Starts with a predefined number of slots (`slot_count`).
   - Slots can be expanded during gameplay, rewarding player progression.
   - Optionally supports a distinction between **unlocked slots** (`unlocked_slots`) and the **total grid capacity** (`slot_count`), allowing for visual feedback on locked slots.

2. **Item Handling**:
   - Items are added to available slots, with a per-slot limit (`max_items_per_slot`).
   - Overflowing items are automatically moved to the next available slot.
   - Items can be removed in quantities, automatically clearing slots when empty.

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Displays a grid of slots with items or empty placeholders.
   - Locked slots (if enabled) are shown visually distinct, encouraging the player to unlock them.
   - Supports custom background and item images for full artistic control.

4. **Progression Mechanics**:
   - Allows developers to dynamically increase the inventory size (`slot_count`) or unlock additional slots (`unlocked_slots`).
   - Easily integrates with rewards, milestones, or in-game purchases.

5. **Scalability**:
   - The system supports both small and large inventories by adjusting `slot_count`.
   - Works seamlessly with a variety of game genres, including RPGs, survival games, and simulation games.

6. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Features draggable and scrollable inventory grids, ensuring smooth navigation even with many items.
   - Designed to be responsive and visually cohesive with customizable UI elements.

### Implementation Details

- **Data Structure**: 
  - Items are stored in a dictionary with keys representing slots (e.g., `item_1`, `item_2`) and values representing item quantities.
  - Items automatically overflow into the next available slot when their quantity exceeds the maximum limit per slot.

- **Customization**:
  - Slot size, grid layout, and scrollbars are fully adjustable to fit the game’s visual style.
  - Custom slot backgrounds and item icons can be easily integrated.

- **Integration**:
  - Expanding the inventory is as simple as increasing the `slot_count` or `unlocked_slots` variable.
  - Easily integrates with Ren’Py’s event system to trigger inventory changes based on in-game events.

### Sample Use Case

1. **Game Start**: 
   - The player starts with a 21-slot inventory.
   - The first 7 slots are unlocked, and the remaining 14 appear grayed out with a locked slot background.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - As the player collects items, they fill available slots.
   - Once a slot reaches its maximum capacity, excess items are added to the next slot.

3. **Progression**:
   - Upon completing a milestone, the player unlocks additional slots.
   - The total inventory grows dynamically, allowing for larger item collections.

4. **Visual Updates**:
   - The inventory screen updates automatically to reflect the new slot count and items.

This system strikes a balance between functionality and simplicity, offering developers a robust inventory framework while ensuring ease of use for players. Whether for an RPG, survival, or visual novel game, the system is versatile and easy to expand.
